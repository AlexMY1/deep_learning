## List of projects
### Spanish VQA Dataset
A collection of notebooks and script which generates automatically a dataset for Doc VQA on spanish slides. This generation uses synthetic data and scraping method. A blog article is joined with the code.
### ResNet X-ray
We fine-tuned a ResNet-18 on a chest x-ray dataset in order to predict COVID-19. The original idea is taken from Coursera but here we add an EarlyStoper during the training.
### Word2Vec Skip-gram
This notebook, with the associated article, helps to understand how Word2Vec Skip-gram algorithm works. This is a good introduction to embedding with neural networks.
### Sentiment clasification with BERT
This notebook is an example of a BERT fine-tuning. We fine-tuned BERT with the ImDB dataset for sentiment classification.
### n-gram model from scratch
This notebook provides an explanation of next word prediction with n-gram. This is a good start to understand more complex models.
### Neural Network from scratch
This project offers a code of the main classes of Keras only with numpy. This is helpfull to understand what is behind the principle of vanilla neural networks.
